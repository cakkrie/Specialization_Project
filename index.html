    <p>As AI systems take on increasingly complex tasks, the computational resources required to process them grow substantially. This often leads to extended response latency in AI products. Such delays present several challenges for user experience. 

    <p>*First, long waiting times test user patience and can lead to frustration, abandonment of tasks, or diminished trust in the system.*Second, interruptions caused by latency disrupt cognitive flow, making it harder for users to maintain continuity in thought and workflow. *Finally, without clear feedback about the system’s current state, users face uncertainty over whether the AI is still processing, stalled, or has failed altogether.</p>

     <!-- Question -->
    <div class="callout">
      <p>How might we reframe latency from a passive waiting period into an active part of the interaction that sustains engagement and confidence in AI product?</p>

    <p>Given the rapid iteration and development of AI models, each serves different disciplines with distinct strengths—for example, code decomposition, visual design, or other specialized tasks.</p>

    <p>While OpenAI has released a leaderboard that is widely accepted in the industry, its benchmarks are primarily designed for ML engineering rather than general users. As a result, users struggle to identify which model best fits their specific needs in this fast-evolving landscape, since different stakeholders prioritize different functions and evaluation dimensions.</p>

    <p>Addressing this gap could help close the cognitive divide between AI products and their consumers. </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>How might we design user-friendly evaluation frameworks that help non-expert users identify which AI model best fits their task needs in a rapidly evolving landscape of specialized models?</p>
